# I recently had a health scare.

Earlier this year I had a similar incident which ended up having to have me land in the emergency room. It was the tail-end of January to be specific enough. Anyway, I'm not sure what happened this time. I felt like I was being observed and I had some strange markings shot in my face, I don't know what it was but something like a fish bone material, a soft calcium type. That's where it feels like the source of the infection started. The rest is just irritation. At any rate, I kept going and feeling sicker and sicker until I couldn't even keep water down. This time, there was no specific symptom to nail it down to, and I didn't go to the Hospital and here's why. First off, the one time I thought I was being poisoned because I couldn't even see straight, so they threw me in the loony bin for observation for like a few days. I guess I can understand but they don't really know what the heck and it was pretty rude. It's more of a small town thing and it was a personal vendetta type thing of hospital workers, staff, and just people that I'd rather have nothing to do with quite frankly, and I damn bloody well mean that! Everyone knows ST. Francis is a dump and it seems like it's a hold up for the mafia or some shit. Well I was bloody well OUTRAGED. I thought my mother was poisoning me. It turns out she was! But not in the intentional sense. Our fridge broke. She was probably ignoring it and I detected that deception. It's been really rough and all our appliances are dying and some of our pets have unfortunately passed. Every research I did I found was everyone all saying the same thing. You NEVER believe these people until you experience it yourself. These things do happen, yes. That's why I'm such an advocate for safety above anything.  

This time it was bad enough to illicit the use of EXTRA STRENGTH GUMMIES. Yes, delta 9s. I don't know what it was that got me sick, I've been eating normally, however, it seems that it was a entire 12 pronged attack. I tell you, I don't know what got me sick, but I know what kept me alive!!!  

Fortunately, and I am seriously putting all joking aside. I still had my prescription from earlier this year. So I was able to take the rest of those and no problem, thank you MEDICAL CENTER/PIEDMONT whatever you guys are these days, this is such a professional place and I was instantly at ease.  

I was in fear for my LIFE at the ST. Francis place. Those people are overworked and there is no safety net to leave this is like 0 tolerance shut up and eat your porridge or we smack you type of stuff. I wasn't going to even press charges I was just wanting to get better maybe I deserved it who knows? I am a jerk lately with my health stuff. But honestly, no one deserves to be punished like that where I'm from. Just informed.  

It is nothing to anyone's character or whatever, this is just the crap I have to go through. I took a bath! It was splendid. Bath salts and all.

After my bath I thought I was going to die, however, it was touch and go. I just made a Halloween post, and wanted to celebrate by at least going OUTSIDE at the Very Least........ i just wasn't feeling good.  

All I could think about was leaving google's squarespace deal where they just pawned us off from google domains onto some strange looking symbol. All color devoid. I was like, hold up google. Not today.

My kidneys could not be felt. I had some kind of parasite or something who the heck knows. Whatever it is, it's gone now.
