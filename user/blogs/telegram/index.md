# Telegram Messenger

I've decided to give telegram messenger a try. I've been reading the way it works compared to the rest and there is really no other choice for encrypted messaging. Signal is nice, they are all nice, however they do not meet the privacy standards. Telegram does. Or at least it seems to, what can one be truly certain of?  

I've used them all. I've been using encrypted messaging since day one simply because I'm the target of crazy lawmen, just like the rest of America. Not only that, but I am the target of hackers, criminals, and just about anyone who is snooping in on conversations when you are sending messages in plain text? It's certain that anyone can read them. We just don't discuss it.  

That's why I've been a staunch advocate of privacy since day one because it just isn't right. The solution is so easy, it should be mandatory, however, they must want an economy of spies.  

## Making the Switch

SO... Telegram it is. All of you that look at encrypting messages as if they are some type of evil, I beseech you to please take into consideration the fact that regular communication can be often overlooked and misinterpreted. For instance, two parties can keep a secret without having to say anything. This is left up to chance to decide who gets to have encrypted conversations due to a roll of the dice who will figure it out or not. Encryption simply ensures that a level playing field is accomplished when wanting a secure line of communication for the average person.

I use it mainly for my family. I talk about sensitive subjects between family and I wouldn't want someone who shouldn't know that stuff knowing it... RIGHT? So that's the main and really my only reason. I pretend that I am some type of big shot needing encryption but the truth is, I don't even have someone to test out telegram with properly... so.  

# SurfShark Update

I think this image came from digital ocean when I hit a 404 or something. Heh, but I am still surfing with the shark. It's a fine program and has worked BEYOND expectations. I'm pleased. I will be returning and recommending this program. I've been using it to read news and watch YouTube and I can tell it is working perfectly I've been so safe. I've *really* tested the limits of this thing as far as freedom goes. It's perfect. It really illustrates a point that at any time what you think is true, is just not so. Really just drives it home.  

They mainly target me with hacking and ads and such like that. Stuff to embarrass and enrage me. Surfshark prevents that. Even the mind games are ineffective. I know the technology works I can see the results. It opened my eyes, I have a clearer world view and my freedom is enhanced and becomes prospective again.  

It's slight little changes, its the proper choices that make all the difference in the world.
