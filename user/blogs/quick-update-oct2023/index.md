# Brief Update

So we are moving providers. I would just like to inform the visitors should their be any disruption that I am doing an entirely unknown process and we will be seeing how it works.  

So far I've had flawless domain service from Google Domains. It's really easy, the interface is quite simple yet its feature rich. The professionalism of the instant updates is just something else. It takes a while to perform these tasks so the fact that it happens like it does, its just splendid.  

They've sold their service, which was in beta to begin with, to squarespace. They are another provider I've seen and they look pretty nice. I've noticed their services and products and they seem to function well.  

It wasn't until recently I've decided to go with Shopify to complete all my purchase with my site. They are more closely alligned with my history, they are using tucows, based out of Canada and they provide a ton of support and API interface logic to handle transactions. They also provide tons of documentation. For all they are offering, I've decided to give them a real concentrated effort. The technologies are open sourced and they are providing full documentation. In software terms, thats really all you can ask for and all you really need. They provide it, there is no mystery and attempted veil. They provide you with the freedom you desire. Whether or not that's able to be utilized properly? Well that's where I come in. Time to really get going and learn this stuff. It's finally at the level I've always required in order to be able to compete with the bigger names out there. I mean, I'm just one man, after all.
