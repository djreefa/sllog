## 🎉 Stephen's Log - Initial Setup

Welcome to my log and postings. You can find information here, I have a developer profile and much more. Links to other works I've done and contact information.

## ⚡ Some of the Works I've Done

- 🎬 🎚 🎛 [NEXFLIX](https://nexflix.stephenlittleton.com/intro.html) - A Fun Movie Review Website Written in HTML5 and CSS3 with JEKYLL as a development scaffold. Utilizes DISQUS for leaving comments and chatting. 

- 🎧 🎚 🎛 [MUSICVIDZ](https://musicvidz.stephenlittleton.com/) - TAKEN DOWN FOR SAFETY CONCERNS

- 🧪 [NEOCITIES](https://stephen730.neocities.org) - A Neocities page, throwback to the old windows style. Jekyll based backend uploaded using WEBDAV. 

- 🧮 [STEPHEN'S DEV PAGE](https://dev.stephenlittleton.com) - Open source listing, work history, skills, general showcase of ability and developer information. Donate links included to PayPal and cashapp for easy payment options.

- 📱 [Gallery](https://gallery.stephenlittleton.com) - My music album, artwork, some fun HTML renderings and more located here.

-  This site / Site utilizes vercel and svelte/qwer theme by kwchang0831. My first svelte project. Currently using netlify for hosting. Vite pushes what I need to the CDN and deployment is fun. Site is very responsive for such a heavy load. Consistent load times.
