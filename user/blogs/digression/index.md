# It's Been a Rough Couple of Weeks

I think I've pinned it down to the freezer. Every time I eat something out of it, I feel ill. Our situation is just like everyone else's lately, it sucks. Definitely not the best circumstances. I've lost my eBay account and upon further inspection it appears that's a common thing to have happen. People are dying so much from food and the news is like the worst of the worst competition. It's enough to drive anyone insane, however, not me. I find it all rather dull and boring. But, what do you really expect I guess.

I'm feeling a lot better, I guess it might have been something on one of the packaging or maybe it's something else, who knows. Whatever it is, it hurts my stomach like crazy. I was down to like 100 lbs, again. The only thing that helped was the Epsom salts bath. That and just regular bath. I was stuck just walking slow and really out of commission. Not a nice experience I tell you what. So, I'm happy to be well and not that bad again. I am not sure but I can't even eat the same things I was eating without experiencing discomfort. Coffee, those little sugar free drink things, tons of red meat and beef. I can't even think about trying that kind of stunt right now. So who even knows what it could be, we have to make some changes around here.

Working with such a momentum that I had, I was going for like 2 years almost every day coding constantly in my spare time or just whenever sometimes all day. I enjoy it, it's a non trivial means of exercising my mind and it also brings a certain pleasure when everything is programmed correctly. But I was working with such a momentum that for it to stop like that was really gut wrenching. In more ways then one. It was just that I have everything feeding the next move and for it to be sidestepped like that, well, it throws everything off.

The site was also down. I wanted so badly to fix it I knew what to do and I knew how to do it but I just had to lay there and let it go. It was actually soothing and easy. I just said, "Forget it!" and moved on. It was a simple task of setting up a nameserver and redirecting everything through cloudflare's nameserver service. It turned out to be quite the fun process to go through. It was easy for me, direct, and they give you many options to choose from. Once I was better, I knocked it out and was up and running even STRONGER than before.

I had a digression. I digressed. It happens, I'm merely human. I have done all this work on my own and without an AI. Of course the web framework is already coded and we simply reuse a lot of code otherwise it would be a few years before I'm able to pump out something even close to this. That's the beauty of it though, top end tech available to anyone and everyone. It's an equal playing field. I learned everything on my own at my own pace and I am so comfortable where I am right now, I am proud of my knowledge and am fully prepared for any situation that may arise. That's priceless. That kind of talent and skill is worth a lot. Unfortunately, it's not respected as well as it should be. Especially where I live.

At any rate, I demand a better life and demand better treatment. I've done absolutely nothing worthy of being treated the way I have and tolerate it no longer will I!

We are calling out the fakes and phonies of today and we will tolerate this crap no longer!
