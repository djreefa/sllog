    </h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my online logbook. This is a svelete, vite, next, and node empowered site. It is heavy on HTML5, CSS3,
      and JAVASCRIPT. I&#39;ve programmed a lot of code using the aforementioned technologies and more such as tailwind,
      iconify, and just all kinds of neat technologies that aren&#39;t listed. The theme was prepacked in a nice neat
      format but I&#39;ve gone through and taken the effort to really get in there and learn everything and customize
      how it all works. I used to be mainly a jekyll and ruby gems guy but now I&#39;m starting to see the power of all
      this REACT WebASM stuff. It&#39;s very nice, it looks great, it works as expected. It&#39;s even a bit beyond my
      comprehension as far as the intricacy goes.

      Hi, I&#39;m Stephen Harry Littleton, I am 42 years old, a straight normal male currently residing in downtown
      Columbus, Georgia, UNITED STATES. I enjoy music, physical activity, relaxing, and everything life has to offer. I
      am single and I am also enjoying that lifestyle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently had some positive experiences and I am ready to start moving forward again. I had a recent trip through
      social media and the internet landscape in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are looking for my older stuff, please let me know so I can put some effort behind bringing it back online.
      If no one liked it, I&#39;ll just keep it offline for now. I don&#39;t know whats what, and I am frightened I
      might inadvertently embarrass myself or portray an image I am not wanting to portray. I&#39;m scared people will
      take it out of context and use it to make me look like a weirdo or whatever after all this hard work. I don&#39;t
      use AI and its all manual hard labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy helping others but I don&#39;t like doing work for them. I will be glad to help share what I know to point
      you in the right direction... just don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be up all night helping you cram for your essays or
      whatever. I don&#39;t mind if you want to clone my site with all the extras instead of the original but I HIGHLY
      recommend that you start from scratch if you are trying to become a developer. It&#39;s a rewarding and fun
      process that deserves the respect it&#39;s due.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have received $0.00 total in donations OF ALL TIME on the internet. I have helped and been helped, however. I
      really want for nothing and I am enjoying every minute of my time online. It&#39;s not profitable and people think
      it is so they do try to target me but there is nothing to target. It gets easier once you get used to it and the
      problems solve themselves when the people with malicious intent start to disappear. I do it because I enjoy it. I
      can delete my entire site, practically smashing it to bits then I can rebuild it again when I feel better.
      It&#39;s immensely rewarding. I love the technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      I AM AVAILABLE FOR HIRE. Part time, gig work, full time, contract, you name it. I am not stupid nor am I naive.
      I&#39;ve turned down a lot of bogus work where people have the wrong idea about what they need. Anything
      electronic I can handle. Systems builder all my life, I&#39;ve kept up with it all this time, I&#39;ve had many
      computers throughout the years and recently I just lost my supercomputer AMD 7, 700, 7000 series high tech 1000w
      gaming beast due to financial reasons because of health and tragedy due to deaths and all kinds of stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&#39;ve never been convicted of a crime and I stay away from the criminal element. That is why I do not have a
      lot of work, I refuse to work for companies like walmart and bestbuy. I prefer a solid smaller AMERICAN company
      owned by someone who cares at least a little about people and who does not treat them like a commodity. This is a
      big ask, I know, but I believe it can be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you give me broken or older PCs? I can make them work again. I can do specialized work, I know all the
      standards and could easily become certified. Basic programming knowledge which I am improving but that can easily
      be expedited should the financial need demand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work well with others, but I do not work well with others who do not work well with others. If you have a bad
      tech, you might as well just call it a day. If you have a team? I can easily integrate with equal responsibilities
      shared among the team. There are those, however, who take advantage of people&#39;s lack of knowledge and they use
      that to launch false arguments with false points and I just can&#39;t do that anymore. I&#39;ve proven too much in
      my life and I have proven myself right when I take a stand time and time again. I will not waste time to go extra
      lengths with a person who is playing games as they are so fond of doing these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honest, loyal, hard working, and I know enough to make crucial decisions that would affect everything. I can take
      more than just a scope, but the entire picture into play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please, call, email, or text me and we can figure out where to go from there. There is nothing like a sit down
      face to face meeting. I have many ways to encrypt our conversations to avoid censorship and spying. Just contact
      me, and we will figure out where to go from there.
