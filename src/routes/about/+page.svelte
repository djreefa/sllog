      Taking this thing down. The project has lost steam and I don&#39;t want to go down with a ship that isn&#39;t even
      mine. The project was meant to include everyone into a fun online adventure through learning and experiencing new
      things that are different, or unusual from the day to day activities we all experience. Unfortunately, there are
      those who believe the unusual is a way of life. They cannot distinguish the difference between reality and
      fantasy. As usual, I am left in the dark to fend for myself while getting laughed at for respecting the laws.
      That&#39;s what is considered a society in this supposed country. Well, as it stands there is no core and its all
      failing and falling apart. The ones who are doing the laughing are shortly lived and are almost all dead at this
      point. A welcome ending to a terrible story. I was punished for attempting to do this project and never rewarded
      except when people appreciated or what not. That&#39;s why I did it, and it&#39;s over now so that&#39;s the end.
      Unfortunately, due to the <em>PROVEN</em>
      human nature around here, I can&#39;t leave it up and just go about my business they have been using everything and
      anything to catch me off guard. My freedoms are being disrespected and I&#39;ve proven it time and time again actual
      proof and they just say I&#39;m discussing things. There is no such thing as a country or whatever guarantees they
      offer. They are all lies as much as you can see the rest of this crap is. At one point? maybe... but they failed to
      offer the proper respect the situation deserves. Everyone just completed what they felt was the right version of what
      to do. Make no mistake, you are all in deep peril and there is nothing your civic leaders can nor will do about it.

      I have work to do and I fail to find the benefit in any of this branded stuff they have you learn just so they can
      rugpull you and hire someone else who is less talented and then change the entire system rednering it virtually
      obsolete just about the time you become perfected in it. These companies are just such failures run from and by
      prison systems.
