Welcome to my source code repository for my main website. That's correct, everything you see here needed to clone my site and become me. Why on God's green earth did I choose to open source my beloved and coveted website? Why not.  

There are many reasons to horde information and I believe the release of this shows some type of advanced knowledge and shared thinking. I mean, I am capable of much more than just a website so why horde it right?  

The truth shines through. Who really cares what fools believe they have no bearing on anything anyways. If someone were to claim rights, its should be apparant what the truth is.  

I did modify this from a theme, who modified already build components, who then used other code, the point is, we all are building and developing this together. You, yourself, may download and modify this as much as you want. You can remove all reference or give some credits, it does not matter. As long as you remain truthful and honest, open source will work to your advantage. IF you rely on deception, however, you will find yourself falling short.
